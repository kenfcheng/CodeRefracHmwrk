II started by changing <title> from “Document” to “Horiseon”.

I Placed comments in appropriate areas for easier referencing. I then went and changed <div> to <header> in the <body>.  While also changing <div> to <nav> in the header section.  This was also corresponding to changing the settings to nav{, nav ul{, and nav ul li{ in CSS.  

Also in CSS, I deleted .benefit-cost{, .benefit-lead{, and .benefit-brand{ as it seemed somewhat redundant. I added background-color, margin-bottom, and color to .div, but not before changing it to aside and <aside> in HTML. I then adjusted the padding in CSS to make the aside match with the content boxes.  

I then replaced <div> at the bottom with <footer>.
